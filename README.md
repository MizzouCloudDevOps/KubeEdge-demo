# KubeEdge-demo

### There is a version conflict between Kubernetes and Bioinformatics workflow.

### Currently the bioinformatics workflow only supports Kubernetes and Kubectl of version 1.19 or earlier. 

### We recommend to install Kubernetes cluster v1.17 and Kubectl client v1.17.

### If you client Kubectl version is too new, it will have issues too.
