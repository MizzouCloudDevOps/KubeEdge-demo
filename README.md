# KubeEdge-demo

### There is a version conflict between Kubernetes and Bioinformatics workflows.

### Currently the bioinformatics workflow only supports Kubernetes and Kubectl of version 1.19 or earlier. 

### We recommend to install Kubernetes cluster v1.17 and Kubectl client v1.17.

### If your client Kubectl version is too new, it will have issues too. 


## This lab currently only works partially for the following 2 conditions: 

1. Works only on KubeEdge example applications, not bioinformatics workflow when using Cluster Version 1.22.2, and Kubectl version 1.23.3

2. Works only for bioinformatics workflow, not KubeEdge example applications, when using Cluster Version 1.17.1, and Kubectl version 1.17.
