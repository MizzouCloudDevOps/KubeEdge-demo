# KubeEdge-demo

### There is a version conflict between Kubernetes and Bioinformatics workflows.

### This lab currently only works partially for the following 2 conditions: 

1. Works only on KubeEdge example applications, not bioinformatics workflow when using Cluster Version 1.22.2, and Kubectl version 1.23.3

2. Works only for bioinformatics workflow, not KubeEdge example applications, when using Cluster Version 1.17.1, and Kubectl version 1.17.
